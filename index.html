        Hello! My name is Amelia Payne and I am a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I graduated highschool in 2022 and took a 3 year gap period where I travelled to Utila, Honduras to get my scuba diving intructor certification and worked the rest of the time I was home. I enjoy snowboarding, art, creative media, listening to music, scuba diving, and spending time with my puppy.

        My dream for the future is to get a job working from home/online for a country that has strong currency, so I can move to a tropical country that has weak currency. I want to live close to a beach where there are big beautiful oceans that I can scuba dive in and learn how to surf, and hopefully never see snow again! My favourite story from my scuba diving adventures is when a Remora attached onto my leg for almost an entire dive, must have thought I was a shark. Or perhaps the time I saw Bottlenose dolphins while coming up from a dive, my favourite animal! Overall, I'm very excited to continue my journey through school and see what more there is out there for me to experience.
